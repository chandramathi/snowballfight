## High-Level Description
**Snowball Fight** is a 3D interactive game built in Unity, where players use a first-person perspective to throw snowballs at animated targets.

---

## Feature List

### Player Mechanics
- First-person camera control.
- Visible modeled arm to guide snowball direction.
- Physics-based snowball throwing with adjustable force and trajectory.

### Snowball Prefab
- Realistic physics (Rigidbody, Collider).
- Snow material and particle effects on impact.

### Target Behavior
- Static and moving targets with hit detection.
  - **Snowmen**: Static targets.
  - **Penguins**: Moving targets.
- Target health system triggering animations and sound effects when hit.

### Game Environment
- Iceberg as the game board.
- Obstacles: snowmen, penguins, and uneven terrain.

### Scoring & UI
- Real-time score tracking.
- On-screen feedback for hits and misses.
- Player loses if they fall off the iceberg.

## Team Assignments

### 3D Models (Created in Blender)
- **Iceberg**: Sam
- **Player Hands**: Yanni
- **Snowball (Projectile)**: Yanni
- **Snowman**: Chandra
- **Penguins/Kids**: Thien

### Motion Handling Teams
- **Projectile & Arm Motion**
- **Target Motion**

## Development Plan
- **Model Creation:** Complete by **February 26**
- **Scripting & Interactions:** Implement core mechanics
- **Final Submission:** Include sound and visual effects

### Checkpoint Goals
- Completed models: Snowman, Hands/Snowball, Iceberg, Penguin
- Basic non-static object motion
- Snowball-target interaction (e.g., hitting a snowman)
- Working score counter

## Materials & External Resources
- **Not Applicable**

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|----------|--------------|
| Model completion delays | Use placeholder assets from Unity Asset Store or previous projects |
| Penguin animations may not work as expected | Pivot to using only static snowmen targets |
| Realistic snowball physics may be challenging | Default to fixed direction and speed based on player view |
